Hello and welcome! My name is Jiayi Zhang (he/him). I am a PhD candidate at [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/), advised by [Chenxiong Qian](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~cqian/). I earned an MSc(Comp) in Computer Science with distinction from HKU in 2023. I received a dual BSc(Eng)(Hons.) and B.M. degree, graduating with First Class Honours in E-Commerce Engineering with Law from [BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/index.htm) and [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2022. My research interests include ML for game security and anti-cheat&cheat in FPS games. 

I'm also an avid Overwatch player. If you play Overwatch, feel free to duo with me (CN or Asia server).
