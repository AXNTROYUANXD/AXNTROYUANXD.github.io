Hello and welcome! My name is Jiayi Zhang (he/him). I have been a PhD student at [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/) since April 2024. I earned an MSc(Comp) in Computer Science with distinction from HKU in 2023. I received a dual BSc(Eng)(Hons.) and B.M. degree, graduating with First Class Honours in E-Commerce Engineering with Law from [BUPT](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/index.htm) and [QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2022. My research interests include AI for game security and anti-cheat/cheat mechanisms in FPS games.
